	# 4. Insert the median value of the residual to an array
	# 5. Move to the next OPD position and re-take measurements

    ## ## 5. let user press a key for either of the following two eventualities:
    ## ##    a. they are satisfied the fit is good, and command the HPC to go to the PL location of max power, or
    ## ##    b. the PL scan seems to be going in the wrong direction, and command the HPC to go back to the starting point and scan anew

    ## ## Last step: set FITS header flag 'FIZ_OPD_AIRY=1'
